      This page demonstrate <code>gapi.auth.authorize(params, callback)</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Initiates the OAuth 2.0 authorization process.
      The browser displays a popup window prompting the user authenticate
      and authorize.
      After the user authorizes,
      the popup closes and the callback function fires.
    </p>
    <p>
      See console for result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: In order for the Oauth to work, pop-up block must be off.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the authentication pop-up is delay
      (i.e. pop-up detected, user click on the link manually),
      the authentication would not work!
