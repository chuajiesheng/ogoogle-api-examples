      This page demonstrate <code>gapi.auth.init(callback)</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Initializes the authorization feature.
      Call this when the client loads to prevent popup blockers from blocking
      the auth window on <code>gapi.auth.authorize calls</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      See console for result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: In order for the Oauth to work, pop-up block must be off.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the authentication pop-up is delay
      (i.e. pop-up detected, user click on the link manually),
      the authentication would not work!
